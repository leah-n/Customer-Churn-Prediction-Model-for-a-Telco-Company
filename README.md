# Customer Churn Prediction Model for a Telco Company
 This GitHub project contains the code and documentation for a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer of a telecom company is likely to churn or not. The model was trained on a large dataset of historical customer interactions and billing data, and it uses a combination of feature engineering, data cleaning, and supervised learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.
